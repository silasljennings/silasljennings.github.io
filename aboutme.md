I’m Luke Jennings, a software engineer exploring creative applications of technology. This blog, **Dev Deviants**, is where I document the projects I build. These projects could be practical solutions, experimental designs, or creative endeavors; however, they all push the boundaries of my mind's understanding of what could be possible with code.

The name **Dev Deviants** reflects my approach: breaking away from the expected, exploring unconventional solutions, and building things that don’t always follow the standard playbook. I work across different tech stacks, choosing tools based on what I feel best fits the project rather than sticking to a singular or conventional route. On this blog you will find I try a multitude of stacks, integrations, and infrastructures. I'm sure I don't always build things the "best way", but I do look to build a version of the product that can iteratively become a good solution. 

Some of my projects are purely for exploration, while others tie directly into businesses I’m building. Ultimately, the goal is to create something unique, functional, fun, and useful to you - the reader. If you're into tech projects, building from scratch, learning as you go, or discussing ideas that don’t fit the usual mold, feel free to subscribe to the blog or reach out. I'm always open to interesting conversations with fellow deviants! Happy reading and happy coding!
